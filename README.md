# ECE 4760 Final Project: RPiano 

![Alt text](side.jpg?)

RPiano incorporates both a physical keyboard, and a software midi synthesizer, allowing users to play the physical keyboard by touching the keys, as well as play any MIDI file. It also supports playing both the physical keyboard and a pre-stored MIDI song simultaneously, allowing synthesizing a duet with the user playing one part and the MIDI synthesizer playing the other. Further, each note can be played simulating 3 different instrument sounds - the grand piano, the harp, and bells.

RPiano has 29 physical keys covering over 2 octaves of a piano. There are a total 8 user controller buttons integrated into the device. The first 5 of them correspond to 5 pre-stored MIDI file songs; pressing the button allows a user to play/pause the particular song. The last 3 buttons correspond to the three instruments - grand piano, harp and bells.

The main code for software can be found in final_project.c
